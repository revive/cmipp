Welcome to Guides on Data Analysis in Particle Physics's documentation!
=======================================================================

This document is aimed to provide an introduction to the necessary tools and methods for the data analysis in particle physics. I hope the students who want to improve their data analysis skill could benefit from it.

The document is divided into two parts. The first part is about the tools, and the second part is about the methods.
