Preface
=======

The ultimate goal of the particle physics is to understanding the fundamental building blocks of our world and the interactions between them. Particle experiments, are always designed to detect the signals after the scattering or collision of particles. These signals are processed with complicated electronics and are finally converted into data and saved on storage devices.

Data analysis is a key step to extrac the underlying knowledge from the huge amount of data.
